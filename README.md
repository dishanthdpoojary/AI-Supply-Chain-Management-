# Supply Chain Optimization with AI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain management using AI and machine learning techniques. The system integrates demand forecasting, procurement planning, route optimization, and inventory management to enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs. The web-based application is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and MySQL.

## Features
- AI-Based Demand Forecasting: Predicts future demand based on historical data and market trends.
- Procurement Optimization: Identifies the most cost-effective and reliable suppliers.
- Route Optimization: Suggests the best routes for transportation, reducing delivery times and fuel costs.
- Inventory Management: Tracks stock levels, incoming and outgoing goods, and warehouse capacity.
- Real-Time Dashboard: Provides an interactive web interface for monitoring supply chain operations.
- Report Generation: Generates insights and analytics on inventory and procurement trends.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Database: MySQL
- AI/ML: Machine learning models for demand forecasting and optimization algorithms
